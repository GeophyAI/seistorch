# Seistorch: Where wave equations meets Automatic Differentiation

From this version, seistorch will use 'torchrun' to perform distributed full waveform inversion('mpi4py' used before). Please refer to <seistorch/examples/check_features/torchrun_dist>. The old mpi4py APIs in seistorch will be deprecated, nccl in torch will be prefered.

Note: I am preparing my dissertation now, so the update may be delayed.
